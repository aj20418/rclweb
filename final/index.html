			<h1 align="center">About Royale Challenge League</h1>
			<p>We are a new Clash Royale league.
			We have two leagues (RCL 1 and RCL 2), and 20 teams per league.
			These teams will battle it out to become champions. After two rounds, the bottom two teams are eliminated.
			You earn one point for a win, and zero points for a loss.
			After we find a champion of RCL 1 and RCL 2, there will be a match between both to see who gets the league title and rewards.</p>
			<h3>How does this work?</h3>
			<p>You will join a clan and fight in a 3v3.
			After every set one player must be subbed.
			This forces a team to have 5 good players.
			There are 3 sets.</p>

			<h3>What's the reward?</h3>
			<p>Each member of the winning team will be given a $5 gift card of their choice (we're starting out small and hopefully looking for a sponsor) to spend in Google Play or iTunes.</p>
